## Music Library UI Assessment ðŸŽµ

Given the albums.json, create a simple UI that can do the following
1. Display the albums as a list of UI components. Each component should render the album artwork image, title, and artist.
2. Sort the albums by its properties: artist name, album name.
3. Remove albums.
4. The `alt` property for each `<img>` tag should be set to the parsed out filename from the url. For example:  "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" should render as `<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" alt="Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" />`


A mock-up has been included to provide visual guidance. Your UI does not have to perfectly match the mock-up.

This exercise should not take more than a few hours. It's okay to get creative but don't stress yourself out!


When you are finished, just zip your local repo and send it on over. And of course, email us if you have questions.
